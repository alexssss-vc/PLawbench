    "Question": "“Lawyer, I’m seriously out of options. Please help me. I’m doing my master’s at the Shanghai Theatre Academy, and I also run an art exam prep training studio. These last few days someone’s been extorting me. If this keeps going, I really won’t be able to take it. Not only could the studio get squeezed until it shuts down, I might even end up getting in trouble myself. What am I supposed to do? Our studio is in Shijiazhuang. A few years ago, after I got into STA, I started it with a friend. Every summer vacation I go back to teach and handle operations. The rest of the year I’m in Shanghai, and my partner in Shijiazhuang manages the day-to-day. But now we’re being blackmailed. My friend said it seems like I’ve even been sued and it might already be in court. But I can’t just fly back to Shijiazhuang to show up in court. If we lose, won’t we be ruined financially? We’d have to shut the studio down. What do I do? We run an art exam prep program, so a lot of teenagers come here to sign up for training. At this age they’re emotional, they spend a lot of time around each other, and sometimes they get into relationships—stuff like that happens. Because of that, one girl’s parent is now asking for a ridiculous amount of money—tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands. We’re a small business. If we pay that much, we might as well close. The parent said if we don’t pay, they’ll sue us, and not just sue us—they’ll also post about it online everywhere, expose our so‑called “wrongdoing,” and make us socially dead. Before I reached out to you, I asked a friend who’s been through lawsuits. He said this is basically threatening to harm my legal rights and interests to force me to hand over money, which could already be extortion, or at the very least civil coercion. But I still don’t feel safe—I really need a professional opinion, or I honestly don’t know what to do. Here’s what happened. This summer I was teaching in Shijiazhuang. One night we had class at the studio. Later it was self-study time, and a male student and a female student went downstairs on their own. Since it was self-study, I went to the bathroom in the middle of it and didn’t notice they had left. When I came back, I realized they were gone. Other students said they went out by themselves, so I didn’t think much of it. But after a long time they still didn’t come back, so I figured I should call them back. I went downstairs and looked around but couldn’t find them. I called them and they didn’t answer. I thought, maybe it’s almost time for class to end and they had something to deal with and just left, so I didn’t push it. After a while class ended and I dismissed everyone. For the next month, everything looked normal. Then one day the girl’s parent suddenly came to cause a scene, saying I didn’t supervise the students properly. Only then did I find out what they claimed happened: apparently that male student took the girl out to eat barbecue, drink beer, then they went to a hotel room, and she ended up getting pregnant. The parent insisted the male student raped her daughter and said they were going to get him locked up, and on top of that they demanded our studio pay tens of thousands—medical fees, abortion fees, all that. As a woman, I did feel bad for the girl, so I transferred 130,000 RMB to the parent as compensation. I thought that would be the end of it, but two weeks later the parent came back saying it still wasn’t enough. They demanded a total of 500,000 RMB. Otherwise, they said they’d not only sue us for money, but also report me as some kind of accomplice or co-offender in a rape case—something like “aiding” or “helping,” I’m not even sure of the exact legal term. But I’m terrified. Honestly, these two students didn’t seem like the kind of kids who’d commit a crime. Usually they got along fine. That day before class they were chatting and laughing, and everything during class seemed normal. How could something like this happen? Lawyer, can you please tell me what I should do? I really don’t want to get myself into legal trouble. If I have to pay a bit more, I can accept it, but isn’t asking for tens or hundreds of thousands way too much? How would something like this actually be handled under the law? Please, I’m begging you—help me.”",

    "Question": "Mr. Huang and his ex-wife have one son, Huang Mouyi. After the divorce, Huang Mouyi is raised by Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang, together with his parents and son, jointly applied for and reside in a public rental apartment. Ms. Ye was previously divorced from her ex-husband and had no children. After each party's prior divorce, they were introduced to each other, registered their marriage on May 13, 2013, and subsequently cohabited in the public rental apartment with Mr. Huang's parents and Huang Mouyi. On November 28, 2013, they gave birth to another son, Huang Moubing. In late 2017, to address Huang Moubing's school enrollment and to purchase commercial housing without forfeiting their public rental housing qualification, Mr. Huang, Ms. Ye, and Ms. Ye's father discussed and executed a \"\"Divorce Agreement\"\" on January 9, 2018, and completed the divorce registration at the civil affairs bureau. The agreement contained only provisions stating: \"\"both parties voluntarily divorce,\"\" \"\"the matrimonial child shall be raised by the female party, with each party bearing 50% of maintenance expenses,\"\" and \"\"no property division or debts exist during the marriage.\"\" Subsequently, on January 18, 2018, Ms. Ye individually entered into a commercial housing purchase contract and purchased one residential unit for approximately 640,000 yuan (down payment of approximately 190,000 yuan and a mortgage loan of 420,000 yuan), with the real estate certificate recording Ms. Ye as the sole owner. On January 4, 2018, Mr. Huang paid Ms. Ye 195,000 yuan to be used toward the down payment. After the divorce registration, both parties continued to reside alternately with their two children in both the public rental apartment and the newly purchased commercial housing, maintained ongoing daily contact and emotional relations, jointly operated an advertising business with frequent economic transactions, and jointly repaid the mortgage. The rental income from a garage owned by Mr. Huang's father in another district was collected by Ms. Ye and used for household expenses. On May 10, 2022, Ms. Ye purchased one lottery ticket for 2 yuan. On May 12, 2022, she won a pre-tax lottery prize of 5,000,000 yuan (400,000 yuan after tax). Ms. Ye was the sole recipient of the award. Ms. Ye failed to truthfully disclose the amount of the prize and only told Mr. Huang that she \"\"won 500,000 yuan.\"\" On August 9, 2022, as the relationship deteriorated and both parties prepared to separate, Mr. Huang and Ms. Ye negotiated regarding the commercial housing, and Mr. Huang drafted a \"\"receipt,\"\" which provided: that the prior divorce registration had been executed for the purpose of enabling the children's school enrollment, the residential property was registered under Ms. Ye's name, and as their relationship had broken down, Mr. Huang would \"\"withdraw from the property and cease to reside therein,\"\" with Ms. Ye obtaining the use rights and ownership of the property and paying Mr. Huang 250,000 yuan, with the statement \"\"from henceforth, there shall be no further emotional or economic disputes.\"\" On the same day, Ms. Ye paid 250,000 yuan, and on the following day, Mr. Huang moved out of the commercial housing. Thereafter, Mr. Huang discovered that Ms. Ye had actually won a lottery prize of 5,000,000 yuan rather than 500,000 yuan, and subsequently brought suit, requesting a determination that property acquired by both parties during their cohabitation following the divorce, including the lottery prize in question, is jointly owned and should be divided accordingly. Answer the following questions using the logic of 【Conclusion】+【Case Facts】+【Reasoning】+【Legal Provisions】: In this case, how should the property acquired by Mr. Huang and Ms. Ye during their cohabitation following their consensual divorce (principally comprising the lottery prize from purchasing lottery tickets and the commercial housing) be divided?

    "Reference": "【Conclusion】Although Mr. Huang and Ms. Ye completed a consensual divorce in 2018, they thereafter maintained a prolonged period of continuous cohabitation, joint business operations, and highly intermingled economic relations. Their legal relationship should be characterized as \"\"non-marital cohabitation\"\" and is no longer governed by the regime for marital joint property. Property acquired during the period of cohabitation following divorce should be processed according to general rules governing co-ownership. During the period of cohabitation, in the absence of a separate written agreement between the parties regarding property, and given that the sources of income and capital flows are highly intermingled, property acquired through joint living and joint business operations during the cohabitation period should, as a matter of principle, be presumed to be jointly owned by both parties in equal shares. (1) Ms. Ye purchased a lottery ticket for 2 yuan and won a lottery prize of 5,000,000 yuan (400,000 yuan after tax). The investment of 2 yuan was made from the parties' intermingled common property and cannot reasonably be distinguished as belonging to either party's individual property. Accordingly, the lottery prize should be treated as joint property of both parties, with each party entitled to a 50% share. (2) The 250,000 yuan previously paid constitutes compensation for the property interest in the commercial housing and does not offset the distribution of the lottery prize. The \"\"receipt\"\" was executed solely on the basis of Ms. Ye's serious concealment of the lottery prize amount and Mr. Huang's material misunderstanding of the circumstances. It represents a one-time settlement of the parties' interests in the commercial housing and cannot be deemed a comprehensive settlement of all property acquired during the cohabitation period, including the lottery prize. The lottery prize should accordingly be divided separately according to co-ownership rules. In summary, the post-tax lottery prize of 4,000,000 yuan should be determined to be owned by Mr. Huang and Ms. Ye at 2,000,000 yuan each. Since the prize has been received solely by Ms. Ye, Ms. Ye should pay Mr. Huang 2,000,000 yuan.\n【Case Facts】(1) Mr. Huang and Ms. Ye were both remarried and had cohabited in the public rental apartment and given birth to one child prior to the consensual divorce. (2) In 2018, in order to obtain housing eligibility and preserve their right to occupy the public rental housing, both parties completed a consensual divorce, thereby formally terminating their marital relationship. However, they substantively continued to reside together with their children and maintain a common household until their separation in August 2022. Both parties jointly operated an advertising business, and daily household expenses were met through pooled income from both parties, with a clear pattern of economic intermingling. (3) Following the divorce registration, Ms. Ye individually purchased commercial housing. The down payment was primarily provided by Mr. Huang, and the mortgage was repaid through their combined income during their prolonged period of joint cohabitation. (4) In May 2022, Ms. Ye purchased a lottery ticket for 2 yuan and won a major prize of 5,000,000 yuan, but represented to Mr. Huang only that she \"\"had won 500,000 yuan.\"\" (5) Subsequently, as their relationship deteriorated and due to property disputes, both parties negotiated. Ms. Ye made a one-time payment of 250,000 yuan to Mr. Huang, with the commercial housing to be retained solely by Ms. Ye. Both parties executed a \"\"receipt\"\" stipulating that \"\"there shall henceforth be no further emotional or economic disputes.\"\" Thereafter, upon learning the true amount of the lottery winnings, Mr. Huang contended that Ms. Ye had exploited an information asymmetry to conceal substantial joint property interests acquired during the cohabitation period and had settled all matters with merely 250,000 yuan, and consequently initiated legal proceedings to request division of the lottery prize, asserting entitlement to a one-half share of the lottery prize.\n【Reasoning】I. Legal Characterization: Transformation from \"\"Marital Relationship\"\" to \"\"Cohabitation Relationship\"\"** **Formally Divorced but Substantively No Longer Subject to the Marital Joint Property Regime** Both parties completed a lawful divorce through the civil affairs bureau registration on January 9, 2018. The divorce registration is legally effective, and the marital relationship has been formally terminated. Regardless of the motivations for divorce—including obtaining housing eligibility or preserving the public rental housing source—such motivations do not affect the legal validity of the divorce itself. Since neither party has registered for remarriage, from the date of divorce onward, the marital rights and obligations and the marital joint property regime under the Marriage Law no longer apply. **Substantively Constitutes a \"\"Post-Divorce Prolonged Cohabitation\"\" Relationship** Following the divorce, both parties continued to live together: - Both continued to reside with their two children in the public rental apartment and the commercial housing; - They maintained cohabitation until August 2022, a duration of nearly four years; - They jointly operated an advertising business, jointly repaid the mortgage, and jointly assumed household expenses. During this period, the legal relationship between the two parties should be characterized as \"\"non-marital cohabitation.\"\" Their property relations are no longer governed by the special regime for marital joint property under the Property Rights Section of the Civil Code, but rather are governed by general rules of co-ownership under property law. **II. Methodology for Determining the Nature of Property Acquired During Post-Divorce Cohabitation** **When a Written Property Agreement Exists, Priority is Given to Performance According to the Agreement** Generally, parties to a cohabitation relationship may clarify property ownership through written agreement: - If a clear written agreement regarding property acquired during cohabitation exists, such agreement shall take priority in application; - If the parties have reached an individual arrangement regarding specific property only, such agreement is limited to that specific property and does not extend to all property by operation of law. In the present case, the only written document is the \"\"receipt\"\" executed on August 9, 2022. Its essential content provides: the commercial housing shall belong to Ms. Ye; Ms. Ye shall pay Mr. Huang 250,000 yuan; and there is a general provision stating \"\"from henceforth, there shall be no further economic disputes.\"\" Considering the context of the execution and the parties' statements, the receipt should be interpreted narrowly as a settlement of matters such as the down payment and mortgage repayment obligations concerning the commercial housing, rather than as a comprehensive and final settlement of all property acquired during the cohabitation period. **In the Absence of a Comprehensive Agreement, Application of the \"\"General Co-ownership + Economic Intermingling + Equal Share Presumption\"\" Technical Approach** During the post-divorce cohabitation period: - Both parties jointly operated an advertising business, with revenues remaining unsettled; - The mortgage on the commercial housing was jointly repaid by both parties; - The garage rental income was collected by Ms. Ye and used for household expenses; - Frequent economic transactions occurred between the parties without a strict delineation of \"\"individual income.\"\" Against this background, the sources and use of property were highly commingled, making it impractical to precisely divide individual shares based on contribution ratios. In accordance with the general rules governing co-ownership under the Civil Code, property acquired during the cohabitation period through joint living and joint business operations, in the absence of special agreement and where the sources cannot be reasonably distinguished, should be presumed to constitute co-ownership in shares. Where the share cannot be determined through evidence, an equal share presumption should reasonably be applied to conform to the \"\"de facto common enterprise\"\" nature of such relationships. **III. The Scope of Validity of the \"\"Receipt\"\": Does Not Constitute an Effective Settlement of the Lottery Prize** **The Receipt Is Based on Severe Information Asymmetry and an Uninformed Statement of Intention** When the receipt was executed, Ms. Ye possessed complete information regarding the lottery winnings (pre-tax 5,000,000 yuan, post-tax 4,000,000 yuan), but disclosed only that the winnings were \"\"500,000 yuan\"\" to Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang, without knowledge of the true amount, expressed his intention to \"\"withdraw from the property and relinquish any further claims to economic matters.\"\" This situation fundamentally involves serious factual concealment. Mr. Huang's statement in executing the receipt was based on material misapprehension regarding the \"\"aggregate value of property acquired during cohabitation,\"\" which substantially diverged from objective circumstances, evidently lacking an adequate informational foundation. **From the Perspective of Content and Purpose, the Receipt Is Essentially a Settlement Regarding Real Property, Not an Agreement for Division of the Lottery Prize** The document is titled \"\"receipt\"\" and its substantive provisions focus upon \"\"the property is registered under Ms. Ye's name,\"\" \"\"withdrawal from the property,\"\" \"\"use rights and ownership of the property accrue to Ms. Ye,\"\" and \"\"payment of 250,000 yuan.\"\" - The document contains no explicit reference to or quantification regarding the lottery prize; - The date of execution is subsequent to the date of the lottery win, and the focus of negotiations concerned residence and real property ownership rather than a consolidated settlement of liquid assets. Accordingly, the receipt can only be interpreted as an individual settlement between the parties regarding the commercial housing property prior to their separation and cannot be deemed an effective agreement for division of all property acquired during the cohabitation period, particularly a substantial lottery prize. Ms. Ye, having concealed a material property fact, attempted through the \"\"property plus 250,000 yuan\"\" settlement to resolve all property issues in a comprehensive manner, which clearly violates the principles of good faith and public policy. The court has reasonable grounds to decline to extend the interpretation of the receipt to encompass a waiver of claims to the lottery prize. **IV. Characterization of the Lottery Prize: Determination of a Substantial Income Acquired During Cohabitation as Jointly Owned** **The Source of the Investment Cannot Be Distinguished: The 2-Yuan Investment for Lottery Ticket Purchase Is Embedded Within the Structure of Economic Intermingling** The 2-yuan investment in the lottery ticket occurred during a period when the parties' economic relations were highly intermingled: - Both parties maintained a prolonged joint household, with living expenses and business investments derived from a common fund; - The 2-yuan investment is minimal in absolute terms and, relative to the overall volume of family economic transactions, is fundamentally incapable of being traced to \"\"individual income of either party.\"\" Under such circumstances, requiring the non-winning party to prove that \"\"the 2 yuan came from common property\"\" would be neither practical nor equitable. The more reasonable approach is to treat the 2-yuan investment made from intermingled funds as derived from common property; consequently, the lottery prize naturally falls within the category of jointly-acquired property during the cohabitation period. **Co-ownership in Shares + Equal Share Presumption Where Specific Share Cannot Be Determined** Although the lottery prize is formally \"\"invested, purchased, and claimed\"\" by Ms. Ye: - There exists no evidence of an agreement between the parties that the prize would belong to the individual at the time of purchase; - The source of the investment cannot be clearly distinguished as individual or common property; - The practical logic of property during the cohabitation period reflects \"\"joint living, joint risk-bearing.\"\" The factual circumstances conform to a pattern of \"\"joint investment, joint living, and shared risk-bearing.\"\" Accordingly, the court applies general co-ownership rules and presumes the lottery prize to be co-owned by both parties in shares. Where the specific investment ratio cannot be ascertained, the adoption of a 50%-50% equal distribution conforms to substantive fairness and transactional security. **The 250,000 Yuan Property Compensation Does Not Offset or Reduce the Distribution of the Lottery Prize** The background, the parties' statements, and the content of the written document regarding the 250,000-yuan payment all indicate that it constitutes a \"\"settlement of property interests in the commercial housing\"\" and does not pertain to the same property item as the lottery prize. Moreover, Ms. Ye's concealment of the prize amount preceded the execution of the receipt. To further deduct this 250,000 yuan from the allocated portion of the lottery prize would create a perverse incentive whereby \"\"partial property is used to compensate for concealment conduct,\"\" thereby violating the principles of good faith and public policy. Accordingly: - The commercial property belongs to Ms. Ye pursuant to the receipt; - The 4,000,000-yuan post-tax lottery prize should be divided between the parties at 2,000,000 yuan each. Ms. Ye should make an additional payment of 2,000,000 yuan to Mr. Huang, which shall not be reduced by virtue of the prior 250,000-yuan property compensation.\n【Legal Provisions】(1) Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, Article 308: Where the co-owners fail to agree that the co-owned immovable or movable is subject to divided co-ownership or undivided co-ownership, or such an agreement is ambiguous, the ownership shall be deemed as divided ownership, unless the co-owners are of a family or have other relations. (2) Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, Article 303: Where the co-owners have agreed not to partition the co-owned immovable or movable in order to maintain the co-ownership, such an agreement shall prevail; however, a co-owner that has any material reason for partition may request partition; in the absence of such an agreement or if the agreement is ambiguous, a co-owner in divided ownership may request partition at any time, while a co-owner in undivided ownership may request partition only if the basis for co-ownership has ceased to exist or partition is justified by any material reason. If the partition causes any damage to any other co-owner, compensation shall be made. (3) Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, Article 304: Co-owners may determine the way of partition through consultation. If no agreement is reached and the co-owned immovable or movable may be partitioned without reducing its value, the property shall be partitioned; if it is difficult to partition the property or the partition will decrease its value, the proceeds obtained from the conversion into money, auction or sell-off of the immovable or movable shall be distributed. (4) Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, Article 147: The actor shall be entitled to request a people's court or an arbitral institution to revoke a juridical act performed based on a material mistake.

    "Question": "Lawyer, listen.\nThis thing is a complete mess. I’ll try to say it clearly, but honestly, it’s really frustrating.\nSo, we’re Jishun Company, based in Gansu.\nIn November 2022, we sold some Chinese herbal medicine to a clinic in Shanghai, Xuhui District.\nThe clinic is called Xu XX Clinic.\nTotal price — 70,000 RMB.\nWe sent the goods three times, not all at once.\nEvery single time, Xu XX signed for it.

Change it from the clinic’s name to the new company’s name.”\nAt that time, the new company didn’t even exist yet.\nBut he keeps saying, “Don’t worry, it’s just paperwork. The new company will take the debt and pay you later.”\nHonestly, we just wanted our money.\nWe thought, fine, if changing a name helps, let’s do it.\nThen in June, the old clinic is officially gone.\nIn July, Du personally takes the medicine away and moves it to their warehouse.\nIn August, his new company finally gets registered.\nThey said they would start trial operations on August 10, using this batch.\nThen later, a guy named Yuan contacts us.\nHe had an authorization letter signed by Du, and a copy of his ID stamped with the company seal.\nHe tells us they want the invoice changed over to the new company.\nSo we reissued the invoice — and the key date here is:\nOn August 25, 2023, we reissued the invoice with the buyer name changed to XX (Shanghai) Traditional Chinese Medicine Health Co., Ltd.\nAnd boom — that’s the trap.\nIn September, we go to their new company in Jing’an to ask for payment.\nAnd suddenly they tell us,\n“Oh, the company has a new legal representative now.”\nThe new guy says:\n“What 70,000 RMB?\nOur company didn’t even exist back then.\nThis has nothing to do with us.\nThat’s Du’s personal problem. Or the old clinic’s problem.\nAnd the medicine? It was delivered last November. How could they not use it?\nAnd Yuan? He’s not our employee. That authorization letter is fake. It doesn’t even have our company seal.”\nFake?\nSeriously?\nWe’re standing there like — are you kidding us?\nWe have the chat history with Du.\nWe have documents with their company stamp.\nWe have delivery records, warehouse records, everything.\nAnd the invoice — the invoice THEY asked us to change, and we reissued it.\nNow the clinic is gone.\nDu is buried in debt, from what we hear.\nAnd the new company just says, “Not our problem.”\nSo what is this?\nThey take the goods.\nThey push the paperwork.\nThey change the company.\nAnd suddenly nobody owes us money?\nThis is not normal business.\nThis is a setup.\nLawyer, we’re suing.\nWe’re suing XX (Shanghai) Traditional Chinese Medicine Health Co., Ltd., because they took the goods and they’re the one denying the debt now.\nAnd Du and Xu XX — they’re all involved. They can’t just walk away.\nThis is a scam. Plain and simple.",
